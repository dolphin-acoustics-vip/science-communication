This code was written to provide an interactive display for attendees at the 2022 University of St Andrews Vertically Integrated Project (VIP) conference. 
It shows dolphin species classifications of live audio input, thus giving an idea of which dolphin species most resembles someone's vocalizations. 
While a real machine learning model is being used for the classifications, the key aim of this is to foster engagement and understanding about our academic work, not to ensure very accurate results.

Note: The machine learning model used in the code, "transfer_learning_classifier_fine_tuned_improved.h5: can be found in the data relevant data folder of the VIP drive.
